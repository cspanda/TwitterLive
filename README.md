# TwitterLive
Provider of information about tweets. 
Hack for MHacks V in Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 16-18, 2015

We're all avid users of Twitter, and we were interested in the statistics behind tweets. We want to provide an easy-to-use and live service that allows anyone to search for a keyword and return information about that word. Using the Twitter Streaming API to obtain access to live tweets, we are able to provide information such as a cumulative count of the number of times that word was used in a tweet since the user requested the information, the average number of tweets per minute that contains that word, and a graph that plots the number of times the keyword was used.

We used Java for backend and Android, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery for front-end and web, MongoDB for our database, and Microsoft Azure to host our server.

We developed both a mobile and a web application for Twilive, so whenever you need to do research for a project, or just curious about tweets on the road, there is always a way for you to learn about your tweets.

Future Goals: 
<ul>
Post some tweets containing the keyword <br>
Post pictures from tweets containing the keyword <br>
Add geographical map and markers to track location of tweets <br>
Add information about tweets in the past with the keyword (using the Twitter Rest API) <br></ul>
